History
-----

The original [Subsonic](http://www.subsonic.org/) is developed by Sindre Mehus Subsonic and was open-source through version 6.0-beta1, and closed-source from then onwards.

At the end of 2015 Popeen forked Subsonic and built the first Booksonic server for his own personal use, this was about half a year before Subsonic went closed-source.

With the announcement of Subsonic's closed-source future the fork Libresonic grew out of what was previously a Subsonic build without license checks created by Eugene E. Kashpureff Jr.

Around July 2017, it was discovered that the maintainer of Libresonic had different intentions/goals
for the project than some contributors had.  Although the developers were
hesitant to create a fork as it would fracture/confuse the community even
further, it was deemed necessary in order to preserve a community-focused fork.
This new fork is what we know today as [Airsonic](http://www.airsonic.org/)
To reiterate this more clearly:

Airsonic's goal is to provide a full-featured, stable, self-hosted media server
based on the Subsonic codebase that is free, open source, and community driven.

Moving on to summer of 2020 and Booksonic has grown to now having a couple of thousand users but the server is still built on top of the old Subsonic codebase as well as full of bugs and is over all not very polished, on top of that community members that want to do their own modifications find it hard to build the server from source. Popeen now decides to fork Airsonic and port the Booksonic functionality over, thus Booksonic Air was born.

Unfortunately, just after Booksonic Air was forked Airsonic received it's last commit so about a year later Popeen decided to once again switch the Booksonic codebase, this time Booksonic was based on [Airsonic-Advanced](https://github.com/airsonic-advanced/airsonic-advanced), an Airsonic fork that has been under active development for a few years and that has made many improvements to the internals of the "XXXsonic code". Hopefully this is where we will stay.
